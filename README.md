Hi!! Iâ€™m Roger, a developer and student at TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey whoâ€™s always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and sharing what I discover with others.

Right now, Iâ€™m working as a Software Development Intern at Hanova Consulting, where I help build Enterprise Resource Planning solutions and integrate AI agents for projects that need a modern approach.

Iâ€™m always open to chatting about tech, learning something new, or collaborating on interesting projects. Feel free to reach out!
